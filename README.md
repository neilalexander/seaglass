Seaglass is a truly native macOS client for Matrix. It is written in Swift and
uses the Cocoa user interface framework.

## Install Seaglass

You can [find the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass/releases)
or you can install Seaglass from Homebrew Cask. Either way, you'll be able to use the built
in auto updating feature to ensure you have the latest version.

```
brew install --cask seaglass
```

## Building from source

Use Xcode 9.4 or Xcode 10.0 on macOS 10.13. Seaglass may require macOS 10.13 as a
result of using auto-layout for some table views, which seems to have been introduced
with High Sierra. I hope to find an alternate way to relax this requirement.

If you do not already have CocoaPods installed, then install it:
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Clone the Seaglass repository and install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/neilalexander/seaglass
cd seaglass
pod install
```
Open up `Seaglass.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build!

## Disclaimer

At this stage it is early in development and stands a good chance of being buggy
and unreliable. I'm also not a Swift expert - I only started using Swift three
or four days before my initial commit - and this code is probably awful. You've
been warned. :-)
